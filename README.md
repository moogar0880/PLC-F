Programming Languages Concepts &amp; Features

HW1
-----
Java #1, This program solves multiple kinds of state-based problems using breadth-first and depth-first searches. The program illustrates the use of Java collections, generic types, interfaces, inner classes and simple I/O.

HW2
-----
Java #2, This program had several parts. We needed to implement 3 data structures (linked list, binary search tree, and a priority queue implemented as a heap) that were all efficiently serializable. We then needed to create a multithreaded server capable of managing any number of "EvalClients" in their own threads which were each responsible for running any number of "EvalTasks" to determine whether a method passed in could be called on an object passed to an EvalClient. This check was done using Java reflection and if it was determined that the method given could be called with the given parameters, the method was called on the object and the result of the method call (or the object itself if the methods return type was void) was added to the servers list of results.

HW3
-----
SML #1, This program covered mostly simple SML functional programming concepts and features.

HW4
-----
SML #2, This program covers multiple topics within SML, including Lazy Evaluation of custom datatypes, as well as memoization of functions.

HW5
-----
Python #1, This program covered introductory Python functions such as implementing a list filter and creating a class representation for USD. It also highlights the use of some more complex techniques such as operator overloading and manipulation of function namespaces. This assignment also presented an opportunity to become more familiar with Python's unittest module, which can be seen in mytests.py.

HW6
-----
Python #2, This program covered more algorithmic topics, such as encoding and decyphering messages and automated word detection using a Trie of custom Node objects.
